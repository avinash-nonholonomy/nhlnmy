# Tools & Software

## Open Source Tools

### Simulation & Analysis
- [icarus verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) - a solid open source verilog simulator. It amazes me how much better it is than some of the professional tools out there.
- [verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/) - another open verilog simulator. It's very very fast, but has some feature mismatches with icarus verilog. Plus tools have bugs, it's very helpful to have two simulators that you can test against each other>
- [gtkwave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) - a graphical tool that lets you examine waveforms from a simulator.
